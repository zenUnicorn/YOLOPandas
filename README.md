Using YOLOPandas to explore and analyze data, and dataframes by writing queries.


The world is changing so fast with the advent of LLMs which means large language models. During my quest for more knowledge on LLMs and how to better leverage what this new tech has in store, I came across YOLOPandas, a tool to interact with Pandas objects via LLMs and LangChain.
In this article, we will dive into YOLOPandas, flex its abilities, and also incorporate it with Comet.
## Overview of YOLOPandas
YOLOPandas is based on Langchain, which is a powerful library allowing abstractions over language models from different providers. It lets you specify commands with natural language and execute them directly on Pandas objects. You can preview the code before executing or set yolo=True to execute the code straight from the LLM
