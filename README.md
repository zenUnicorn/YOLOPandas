# YOLOPandas üêº 
Using YOLOPandas to explore and analyze data, and dataframes by writing queries.


**YOLOPandas** is based on Langchain, which is a powerful library allowing abstractions over language models from different providers. It lets you specify commands with natural language and execute them directly on Pandas objects. You can preview the code before executing or set `yolo=True` to execute the code straight from the **LLM**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: 
YOLOPandas will execute arbitrary Python code on the machine it runs on.
